const PI = 3.14

var has a function scope and can be redeclared, let has a block scope, and will prevent itself from being redeclared.
const can not only not be redeclared, it also can't be reassigned. 
It remains a fixed value, though that value might be a reference to an object, 
on which the properties can change, even if the pointer to the object can't

Unlike const, let can be reassigned, but they otherwise behave quite similarly.

Hoisting happens when using var, where the variable declarations were effectively brought to the top of the file, 
this changed the errors that occured throughout the times the variable was accessed too early, because though one might expect it to not exist
it did, it was just undefined.
